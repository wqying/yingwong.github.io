                        This research project combines reinforcement learning, computational modeling, 
                        and cephalopod neuroscience to explore how episodic-like memory and adaptive 
                        navigation strategies emerge in natural agents, and how they can be implemented 
                        in autonomous systems.

                    <p>
                        My primary contribution to the CuttleBot 2.0 project was the design and 
                        development of the entire simulation pipeline used to model the neurorobot’s 
                        episodic-like memory, foraging behavior, and reinforcement learning architecture. 
                        I translated biological principles from cephalopod cognition into a computational 
                        framework that could be tested, analyzed, and eventually deployed onto the physical 
                        robot. My work sat at the intersection of cognitive science and AI/ML, focusing on 
                        building systems that learn, adapt, and make context-sensitive decisions.

                        <h2>Technical Summary</h2>
                    </header>

                    <p>
                        The computational architecture of the CuttleBot simulation was designed to mirror 
                        the cognitive and behavioral principles observed in biological cuttlefish. At its core, 
                        the agent integrates three components: an episodic-like memory system, a 
                        reinforcement-learning engine, and an abstracted grid-world environment that 
                        reproduces ecological foraging conditions.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The episodic-like memory module encodes the <strong>what-where-when</strong> of each 
                        encounter—prey type, spatial location, and time step—storing these as structured 
                        memory traces that dynamically inform action selection. These traces shape the 
                        agent’s understanding of reward distribution, predator risk, and temporal patterns in 
                        prey availability.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Decision-making is governed by a <strong>Q-learning algorithm</strong> built around a 
                        high-dimensional state space including position, heading direction, hunger level, and 
                        temporal context. The agent selects actions through a softmax policy that balances 
                        exploration and exploitation. Rewards for capturing prey, penalties for predator 
                        encounters, and hunger-based modifiers enable the emergence of selective, 
                        opportunistic, and risky foraging behaviors.

                    <p>
                        As the project progresses toward real-world deployment, I also worked extensively 
                        with the <strong>TurtleBot4 hardware</strong> to prepare the platform for physical integration. 
                        This involved troubleshooting driver and sensor configuration issues and implementing 
                        the foundational robotics software stack using <strong>ROS2</strong>. I configured 
                        <strong>SLAM</strong> for environment mapping, <strong>Nav2</strong> for path planning and behavior 
                        tree-based navigation, and tested autonomous movement using LiDAR-based 
                        localization. These components will allow the neurorobot to eventually perform 
                        real-time foraging behaviors in a physical environment that reflects the simulation 
                        conditions.

                <section class="post">
                <header class="major">
                    <h2>Simulation Results</h2>
                </header>

                <p>
                    The simulation provided a controlled environment to evaluate how episodic-like 
                    memory and reinforcement learning shape foraging strategies across five 
                    ecologically inspired scenarios. Over 30 independent 12,000-timestep runs, the 
                    agent demonstrated context-sensitive behavior that aligned with the cognitive 
                    patterns observed in biological cuttlefish.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Key findings included strong selective foraging when desirable prey was abundant, 
                    opportunistic foraging when shrimp was removed, reduced risky foraging in 
                    predator-dense areas, and evidence of temporal learning during periodic prey 
                    replenishment. The agent’s hunger-modulated decision cycles closely matched 
                    expected motivational patterns, and cumulative reward curves showed gradual 
                    improvement in decision efficiency over time.
                </p>

                </span>

                <p>
                    Together, these results support the hypothesis that episodic-like memory 
                    meaningfully contributes to adaptive behavior. The simulation validated the 
                    underlying cognitive architecture and provides a strong foundation for implementing 
                    the same decision-making system on the physical neurorobot.
